## Training Course Creation Page Requirements

Page Title: "Create Training Course"

## Purpose:

The primary function of this page is to enable course authors to design and establish training courses. Essential elements for initiating a basic course include a title and a description. Additional, optional fields that can enhance the course include learning objectives, facilitators, participants, and a detailed course outline. This design aims to facilitate the creation of a course in draft mode, allowing for further development and collaboration before finalizing all details.

2. **Optional Enhancements**: Authors can enrich the course by adding optional elements such as learning objectives, names of facilitators, participant details, and a comprehensive course outline.

3. **Draft Mode**: The page supports saving the course in a draft state. This feature is crucial for enabling authors to save their work in progress, collaborate with others, and make revisions before finalizing the course.

4. **Collaboration-Friendly**: The design of the page encourages collaboration, allowing multiple authors to contribute to the course development.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The layout of the page will be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth course creation process for the authors.

6. **Guided Process**: To assist authors, especially those new to course creation, the page will offer guidance and tips for each section, helping them understand what information is needed and why.

7. **Preview Option**: A feature to preview the course as it would appear to participants, giving authors a chance to review and modify before publication.
