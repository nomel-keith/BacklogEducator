## Enhanced Details for the Course Outline Section:

Top-Level Time Box (Course Timeline):

This section begins with setting a top-level time box for the entire course, which includes specifying the start and end dates.
This overarching time frame defines the total duration of the course.
The specified start and end dates will correspond to a 'sprint' in Azure DevOps Boards, representing the complete course period.
Sprints within the Course Timeline:

Within the main course timeline, there will be smaller segments referred to as 'sprints'.
Each sprint will require a title and a description.
Course authors must define the start and end dates (range) for each sprint.
These sprints are designed to break down the course into manageable blocks or modules.
Validation for Sprint Timelines:

The system will include a validation feature to ensure that the start and end dates of each sprint fall within the overall course timeline.
This validation is crucial to maintain consistency and logical progression within the course structure.
Input Fields for Sprint Details:

For each sprint, input fields will be provided for entering the title, description, and the start and end dates.
The input interface will be user-friendly, allowing easy navigation between different sprints and the overall course timeline.
Interactive Course Timeline Visualization:

The course outline section will feature an interactive timeline visualization.
This visualization will display the main course timeline along with the individual sprints within it, offering a clear and comprehensive view of the entire course structure.
Error Handling and Guidance:

In case of invalid date entries for sprints (dates outside the main course timeline), the system will display error messages and provide guidance for correction.
The error handling mechanism will be intuitive, guiding course authors to maintain the logical sequence and integrity of the course timeline.
Flexible Modification:

Authors will have the flexibility to modify the start and end dates of sprints as long as they remain within the confines of the overall course timeline.
This flexibility is essential for accommodating changes or adjustments in the course planning phase.
